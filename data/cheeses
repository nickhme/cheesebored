		"name": "Beemster Classic",
		"origin": "Netherlands",
		"image": "https://ga-cheesebored.herokuapp.com/images/beemster-classic.jpeg",
		"tastingNotes": "This cheese looks and feels similar to parmesan but it is more closely related to gouda in taste and texture. The first thing you will notice when tasting the Beemster Classic is the smooth, creamy texture followed by a sharp, salty flavor due to its extensive aging."

	},
  {
		"name": "Feta",
		"origin": "Greece",
		"image": "https://ga-cheesebored.herokuapp.com/images/feta.jpeg",
		"tastingNotes": "Greece's most famous traditional cheese, feta is an important part of the Greek diet and is used daily in salads, pastries, and a simple (and simply delicious) fried-cheese appetizer called \"saganaki\". The fact that it's made primarily from pure ewe's milk (often with some goat's milk) and ripened and stored in brine gives feta a salty, milky, slightly acidic taste."
	},
  {
		"name": "Gorgonzola",
		"origin": "Italy",
		"image": "https://ga-cheesebored.herokuapp.com/images/gorgonzola.jpeg",

		"name": "Halloumi",
		"origin": "Cyprus",
		"image": "https://ga-cheesebored.herokuapp.com/images/halloumi.jpeg",

		"image": "https://ga-cheesebored.herokuapp.com/images/lancashire.jpeg",
		"tastingNotes": "Lancashire's combination of a delicate texture and rich, creamy flavor places it in a distinct category of its own. Lancashire, like most British cheeses, is the perfect complement to a good beer or ale."
	},
  {
		"name": "Mahón",
		"origin": "Spain",
		"image": "https://ga-cheesebored.herokuapp.com/images/mahon.jpeg",
		"tastingNotes": "A unique cheese with a sweet and fruity aroma and a rich, bold flavor, Mahón is not for those who prefer bland cheeses."

  {
		"name": "Manchego",
		"origin": "Netherlands",
		"image": "https://ga-cheesebored.herokuapp.com/images/manchego.jpeg",
		"tastingNotes": "Manchego has a distinctive flavor and an equally distinctive look. It can be recognized by a unique zigzag or cross hatch pattern on its black-gray or buff-colored rind which is created by the rippled surface of the press used to make it. Don’t eat the rind—it’s inedible— but inside you’ll discover an ivory-colored interior with several small holes that’s a real treat."

		"origin": "Italy",
		"image": "https://ga-cheesebored.herokuapp.com/images/pecorino-toscano.jpeg",
		"tastingNotes": "Although it's usually eaten as a table cheese, try it shaved on top of fresh beans, summer salads, or lightly sautéed greens. Use it instead of Parmigiano on your next bowl of pasta. Its flavor is dense and nutty with a wonderful rustic finish."

	},
  {
		"name": "Port Salut",
		"origin": "France",
		"image": "https://ga-cheesebored.herokuapp.com/images/port-salut.jpeg",
		"tastingNotes": "Port Salut is a semi-soft natural cheese that is most recognized by its orange rind. Don’t be put off by the smell—which can be strong because it’s a washed rind cheese. It will still have a relatively mild flavor—savory and slightly sweet. The smell will increase the longer the cheese is kept but, again, the smell doesn’t affect its flavor."

		"origin": "France",
		"image": "https://ga-cheesebored.herokuapp.com/images/roquefort.jpeg",
		"tastingNotes": "Roquefort has a tingly pungent taste, a distinct bouquet, and a flavor that combines the sweet burnt-caramel taste of sheep's milk with the sharp, metallic tang of the blue mold."
	},
  {
		"name": "Salemville Armish Blue",
		"origin": "USA",
		"image": "https://ga-cheesebored.herokuapp.com/images/salemville-amish-blue.jpeg",
		"tastingNotes": "This cheese has a rich, earthy flavor, well balanced and flavorful. Crumble on salad or pasta tossed with garlic and olive oil, stir into hot mashed potatoes or transform a vinaigrette into delicious blue cheese salad dressing by adding Amish Blue to it."
	},
  {
		"name": "Smoked Gouda",
		"origin": "Netherlands",
		"image": "https://ga-cheesebored.herokuapp.com/images/smoked-gouda.jpeg",
		"tastingNotes": "Smoked Gouda is a bit nuttier tasting than the regular Gouda. Containing 45% butterfat, it’s buttery, creamy and smooth with sweet and salty notes."

		"origin": "England",
		"image": "https://ga-cheesebored.herokuapp.com/images/stilton.jpeg",

		"name": "Wensleydale",
		"origin": "England",
		"image": "https://ga-cheesebored.herokuapp.com/images/wensleydale.jpeg",
		"tastingNotes": "Descriptions of White Wensleydale are somewhat paradoxical. It is firm but not dry or hard; creamy with a surface that is crumbly; slightly sweet but also tart in flavor."
